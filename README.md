# Bay Area House Mapper

Provides additional context to locations in the Bay Area.  You can add locations by entering an address or drag-and-drop a Redfin CSV export.  The map shows BART locations, Trans Bay buses, ferry stops, and casual carpool pick-ups.  You can add and adjust buffers around any combination of transit options to quickly see what's within a certain radius.

This is still a work in progress.  Check out the demo [here](http://briefjudofox.github.io/bay-area-house-mapper/web/).
